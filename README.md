# Deploy your server locally üñ•Ô∏è

To run the server on your local machine just follow these steps:

1. Make sure to have the latest Node js version installed [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)
2. Clone this repository and change directory to it.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Install a MongoDB database locally. [Install MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v3.0/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/)
5. Run `mongo` to connect to your database, just to make sure it's working. Once you see a mongo prompt, exit with `Control-D`.
6. Launch Parse Server with `npm start`. By default it will run on `localhost/parse`.

Your Parse Server is now running and is connected to your local database named `dev` in which the data is stored that you manage via Parse Server.
